Building
========

Prequisites
-----------

In order to build this web application, you need to download the qooxdoo
framework first. Currently this is version 2.0.2, but any later should
work, too.

  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/qooxdoo/qooxdoo-2.0.2-sdk.zip

Unzip this file into the parent directory of the gosa directory, so that you
have this structure:

  .../qooxdoo
  .../gosa

GOsa itself uses a couple of contributed modules which cannot be pulled
from the original contrib project. They're included as a git submodule.
Please initialize the submodules before proceeding:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update


Building
--------

Do do a binary build, execute:

  ./generate build

in GOsa's top level directory. The directory "build" will contain a
deployable version after that - which needs to be placed on a clacks-agent
with the gosa-plugin enabled.

If you try to run this standalone in a browser, you'll have to tweak
your cross domain settings and setup proper webserver configurations to
route /rpc, /cache, etc. accordingly.

However - it is recommended to serve GOsa thru the clacks-agent.
