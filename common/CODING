GOsa coding guidelines
======================

The coding guidelines are provided by pep8. To make sure your code
matches the guidelines, install python's pep8 utility and run it
against your source code.

If your code is placed in "plugin.py", it should pass the command

$ pep8 plugin.py

without any messages.

Additionally you can make use of the nosetests in the complete code:

$ nosetests
